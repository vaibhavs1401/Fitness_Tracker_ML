**Fitness Tracker**


Processed and analyzed MetaMotion accelerometer and gyroscope data to classify barbell exercises and count repetitions.
Cleaned and transformed raw sensor data using outlier detection (Chauvenetâ€™s criterion, Local Outlier Factor) and feature engineering (frequency analysis, PCA).
Built predictive models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks) to classify exercises.
Developed a custom algorithm for repetition counting, automating data pipelines for improved efficiency
